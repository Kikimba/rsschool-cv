Hey! What's up. 
Well, is it boring to write about me? I will try to make it short.
Sociable, benevolent, although you can't say so. I will always try to help if someone asked me.
I will not say that I am a fast learner or stress-resistant because I am not.


I can motivate myself "out of thin air", in fact, as well as lose motivation.
I can work all day long if I start doing it. I donâ€™t keep track of time and go headlong into what I do.
I always try to find a reason to be proud of myself. But there is no limit to perfection, so Im not proud of myself yet) . 
I don't know if I can be proud of 1.5 education. First is Higher and half more is Secondary special. 

My goal is to learn front-end development.
I plan to become a good specialist and go to full-stack in future. Hope to study UX / UI deeper in the future and already make money on Layout(?) and Front/Back-end.

All my work experience is industrial practice related to Design (previously) and Development (now).
